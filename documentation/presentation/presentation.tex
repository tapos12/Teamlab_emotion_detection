\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Task Description}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Emotion Detection is a subtask of Sentiment Analysis
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Used to find out feelings towards products, topics, etc.
      \item Companies can use it to assess the quality of their services, public figures their popularity
    \end{itemize}
    \item We were provided with a ~1.63 million tweet corpus
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Comprises tweets which use one of 8 emotions in a hashtag (e.g. \#happy)
      \item Distribution of emotion classes:\\~\\

        \begin{axis}[
        height=150pt,

        ylabel=\%,
        ytick={0,10,20,30,40,50},
        xticklabels={,happy,love,sad,anger,fear,surprise,disgust,trust}]
        \addplot+[ybar] plot coordinates
          {(0,48.98) (1,18.57) (2,14.88) (3,7.47) (4,6.88) (5,2.77) (6,2.28) (7,2.16)};
        \end{axis}
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Approach}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Approach}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We use the body of the tweets as only information source
    \item We extract features from the text in the body
    \item We train a Naive Bayes and a Perceptron classifier with these features
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Experimental Design}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Experimental Design}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We use the training set (75\%) for training and the dev set (25\%) for evaluation
    \item Only boolean features
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All tokens are normalized to lowercase
      \item ``@\$\{username\}'' is normalized to ``@USERNAME''
    \end{itemize}
    \item Two sources of features:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Bag of words
      \item Concatenation of two consecutive words
    \end{itemize} 
  \end{itemize}~\\
  Naive Bayes:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Uses Laplace smooting with $\alpha=0.06$ for unseen words
  \end{itemize}~\\
  Perceptron:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The training data is shuffled before every epoch
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Next Steps}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Next Steps}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 31\% of tweets in the training set and 25\% in the dev
      set come with an image
    \item We want to use the image as an additional source of information
    \item Simple approach:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Split the image into subframes evenly and calculate the median color value
      \item Extract brightness, hue and saturation from each pixel

  \item Train our perceptron with the extracted features
  \end{itemize}
  %\begin{itemize}
    \item Better approach:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict emotions
        based on the images
      \item Combine this with a neural network that learns to predict emotions from the text
    \end{itemize}
    \item Touhidul will finish the Perceptron based image classificator, Simon will start implementing the CNN
